# TokenOpt CLI

TokenOpt is a reusable context-budget middleware for coding agents. V1 is Codex-first and ships as a global npm CLI, while the core policy engine stays independent from CodeGraph and other repository indexers.

## Install Locally

Full setup guide: [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).
Copilot-specific setup: [COPILOT_SETUP.md](COPILOT_SETUP.md).
Project idea and architecture: [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md).
Prompt and benchmark-backed routing playbook: [PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md](PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md).

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli.js doctor
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `npm.cmd` if script execution policy blocks `npm.ps1`:

```powershell
cmd /c npm install
cmd /c npm run build
node dist/cli.js doctor
```

Config precedence is:

```text
built-in defaults -> ~/.tokenopt/config.json -> <repo>/.tokenopt/config.json -> env/CLI flags
```

The Codex installer writes hook commands as absolute `node <tokenopt-bin-js>` invocations, avoiding npm and shell shim differences across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Gated MCP Mode

Codex hooks are useful when they fire, but they are not the only way to route agent work through TokenOpt. For stricter enforcement, disable Codex's built-in shell tool and add TokenOpt as an MCP stdio server:

```toml
[features]
shell_tool = false

[mcp_servers.tokenopt]
command = "node"
args = ["<tokenopt-repo>/dist/cli.js", "mcp", "--mode", "lite"]
required = true
default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"
```

By default, `tokenopt mcp` runs in `lite` mode to reduce MCP tool-schema/context overhead. Lite mode exposes:

```text
tokenopt_compile_evidence
tokenopt_search
tokenopt_read_file
```

Use `tokenopt mcp --mode full` only when you want command execution, standalone project facts, and task-shaped Java/review/debug helpers exposed:

```text
tokenopt_run_command
tokenopt_project_facts
tokenopt_prepare_java_diff
tokenopt_jakarta_annotation_filter
tokenopt_assemble_spring_context
tokenopt_business_contract
tokenopt_impact_analysis
tokenopt_symbols_find
tokenopt_symbol_packet
tokenopt_test_neighbors
tokenopt_failure_packet
```

In this mode, shell commands, searches, and file reads can be routed through TokenOpt-controlled tools that deny broad reads/searches, return bounded file slices, compress command output, and preserve raw logs under the user cache.

Full mode also exposes the regex-lite Coding Coverage Layer. For `implement`, `write_unittest`, and failure/debug tasks, `tokenopt_compile_evidence` now requires exact coding coverage before `answerable=true`: target symbol, signature or definition slice, dependencies/usages, test neighbors/style, build/test command, and parsed failure context when available. Missing coverage returns exact followups such as `tokenopt_symbols_find`, `tokenopt_symbol_packet`, `tokenopt_test_neighbors`, or `tokenopt_failure_packet` instead of treating repo inventory as enough context.

`rg` is only the fast search provider, not a hard requirement. MCP search and project inventory try providers in this order: `rg`, `git`, then a bounded built-in Node scanner. Tool output includes `searchProvider` so benchmark reports and agent transcripts show which provider was used instead of stopping at "rg not found".

`tokenopt_compile_evidence` is a cost gate, not a mandatory extra step. Use it first when it can replace broad exploration: onboarding/build handoff, repo overview, business/domain summary from docs/inventory, implementation planning, and unit-test planning. Do not use MCP-first for exact existing-flow, class, method, or PBI deep dives when the agent will still need native shell/search reads; that hybrid path spends MCP context and then pays the normal shell cost again. For those tasks, either use normal narrow shell/search directly or run a strict MCP-only session with shell disabled. If the packet is `answerable=true` and recommends `answer_now`, TokenOpt stores short-lived repo state and gates redundant MCP searches/reads/commands with a compact "answer now" response. Codex hooks can also deny shell grep/search after an answerable packet, or after a non-answerable packet has TokenOpt followups; MCP alone cannot disable a host shell tool.

Prompts that require an artifact but do not include one now use `needs_input_bypass`. Examples include PBI planning without PBI text, requirement analysis without a requirement, unit-test planning without a target class/module/behavior, review-memory promotion without completed-task evidence, and review prompts without a concrete diff or scope. `tokenopt_compile_evidence` returns a small `answerable=false` packet with `recommended_next_action=ask_user`, `max_additional_calls=0`, and no repository inventory scan.

Security review uses a separate `security_audit` route instead of generic review fallback. It requires scope plus security-specific coverage for input boundaries, auth/authz, validation/deserialization, secrets/config/dependencies, and tests or guardrails before `answerable=true`. Without that coverage, TokenOpt allows only exact followups or asks for the missing scope; it does not encourage broad shell exploration.

When a prompt names a specific target such as a module, class, route, flow, or business capability, TokenOpt requires packet evidence to mention that target before `answerable=true`. If target-specific evidence is missing, the packet stays `answerable=false`, marks `target_specific_evidence=missing`, and returns exact TokenOpt followups instead of letting the agent switch to raw shell/search.

For coding tasks, target matching is stricter than suffix matching. A request for `UnknownBillingService` cannot be marked covered just because another `*Service` symbol exists; the packet stays non-answerable until the exact target is found or the agent follows the bounded coverage followups.

To avoid MCP overhead becoming larger than the saved context, `tokenopt_compile_evidence` returns compact output by default and only returns a small `packetSummary` in structured content. The full packet is stored in `state_path`. Use `detail=full` or `include_structured_packet=true` only for debugging, quality audits, or benchmark reports.

MCP tools also need agent instructions. Emit or install the reusable prompt snippet:

```bash
node dist/cli.js instructions emit --target agents
node dist/cli.js instructions install --target agents
node dist/cli.js instructions install --target copilot
node dist/cli.js instructions install --target copilot-path
node dist/cli.js instructions install --target copilot-agent
node dist/cli.js instructions graph
node dist/cli.js instructions install-graph
node dist/cli.js instructions prompts
node dist/cli.js instructions install-prompts
```

`agents`/`codex` writes `AGENTS.md`; `copilot` writes `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; `copilot-path` writes `.github/instructions/tokenopt.instructions.md` with `applyTo: "**"`; `copilot-agent` writes `.github/agents/tokenopt-cost-gate.agent.md`; `instructions install-prompts` writes `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` for native Copilot slash prompts. The prompt pack covers business deep dives, flow traces, trace-bug, implementation and PBI planning, requirement analysis, unit tests, review/security, refactor scope, performance/dependency/context analysis, onboarding/build handoff, and SpecKit planning. These files tell agents to use TokenOpt as a cost gate, answer from the packet when `answerable=true`, and avoid MCP-first plus shell fallback for exact code-flow/class/PBI tasks.

`instructions graph` plans a shorter root instruction plus path-specific review/runtime instruction files. `instructions install-graph` writes that graph with TokenOpt markers so root guidance stays small while review/debug guidance stays near relevant paths.

For Copilot CLI, use the one-command project setup:

```powershell
node <tokenopt-repo>\dist\cli.js setup copilot --scope both
node <tokenopt-repo>\dist\cli.js doctor copilot
```

This installs `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/tokenopt.instructions.md`, `.github/agents/tokenopt-cost-gate.agent.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`, and merges a lite `tokenopt` stdio MCP server into `<home>/.copilot/mcp-config.json` using `node <absolute-tokenopt-cli-js> mcp --mode lite`. It does not install Copilot hooks yet; TokenOpt's Copilot integration is MCP + instructions + native prompt files today. Add `--include-run-command` only for repos where Copilot should run builds/tests through TokenOpt MCP.

After setup, use Copilot/Codex normally. In Copilot UI, call native slash prompts such as `/investigate-flow <area>`, `/e2e-trace-flow <endpoint>`, `/bug-trace <failing test or stack frame>`, `/write-unittest-class OrderService payment authorization`, `/investigate-pbi <PBI>`, `/review-code <diff>`, or `/security-audit <diff or PR scope>`. In Codex, type natural tasks; `AGENTS.md` carries the routing rules.

## Benchmark

Run the repeatable acquisition benchmark:

```bash
node dist/cli.js benchmark daily --repo <repo-a> --repo <repo-b> --task all --mode all --repeat 5 --randomize --show-answers --out benchmark-results/daily-large-repos.json
```

The benchmark reports model-visible tool input/output chars, final output chars, estimated input/output/total tokens, quality score, quality checks, tool calls, MCP calls, shell calls, route decision, router regret, estimated avoided tokens, and fallback-after-answerable. `--repeat` and `--randomize` support multi-run randomized order checks. `gold-packet` is an oracle/gold-packet upper-bound diagnostic.

```text
baseline
compiled-packet
compiled-shadow-gate
compiled-packet+gate
router-best
router-shadow-gate
router-shadow-gate+compressors
gold-packet
oracle-packet
```

Daily tasks:

```text
build-handoff
investigate
research-business
implement
write-unittest
```

The complete research suite is available at `examples/contextgate-37-prompt-suite.example.json` and can be run with:

```bash
node dist/cli.js benchmark suite --suite examples/contextgate-37-prompt-suite.example.json --repo <target-repo> --mode baseline,router-best --max-tasks 37 --markdown benchmark-results/complete-suite.md --out benchmark-results/complete-suite.json
```

Quality is scored by deterministic rubric checks against the generated benchmark answer. This measures the acquisition layer and answer-readiness directly. It does not replace a full model E2E judge; use it to verify whether TokenOpt reduces evidence replay before running agent-level A/B tests.

For daily TokenOpt + CodeGraph comparisons, `tokenopt-codegraph-adaptive` routes review/security/missing-artifact tasks through TokenOpt-only and uses compact TokenOpt+CodeGraph with shell disabled for flow, implementation, and refactor tasks. Suite reports include raw total tokens, fresh tokens, and quality per 10k fresh tokens.

For agent-level measurement through the real Codex CLI:

```bash
node dist/cli.js benchmark codex-daily --repo <target-repo> --task build-handoff --mode all --show-answers --out benchmark-results/codex-daily-target.json
```

This runner executes `npx @openai/codex@0.137.0 exec --json`, parses `turn.completed.usage`, counts shell and MCP tool calls, records raw JSONL logs, and scores the final Codex answer with the same task rubric.

For implementation workflow A/B measurement:

```bash
node dist/cli.js benchmark workflow-ab --repo <target-repo> --feature-file <feature.json> --workflow baseline,tokenopt,speckit,speckit-tokenopt --out benchmark-results/workflow-ab.json --markdown benchmark-results/workflow-ab.md --show-answers
```

This runner creates isolated git worktrees from the same base commit, runs the feature with baseline Codex instructions, TokenOpt evidence-first instructions, Spec Kit style specify/plan/tasks/implement instructions, and an optional hybrid Spec Kit + TokenOpt evidence-gate workflow, parses real Codex usage, runs the configured validation command, and reports token burn, diff stats, changed files, quality checks, and raw log paths.

For TokenOpt workflows, the implementation benchmark uses `--mcp-mode lite` by default to avoid measuring full MCP tool-schema overhead when the prompt only needs `tokenopt_compile_evidence`, `tokenopt_search`, and `tokenopt_read_file`. Use `--mcp-mode full` when you intentionally want command execution, project facts, Java diff helpers, business contract, impact analysis, or symbol/test-neighbor helper tools exposed during the agent run.

The TokenOpt workflow is adaptive rather than MCP-mandatory. If a feature is exact and small, such as a known command/class/test surface with a targeted validation command, the correct TokenOpt behavior is to bypass MCP-first and use bounded native search/read. The final JSON should report `acquisition_mode=tokenopt_bypass` or `speckit_tokenopt_bypass` for that case. Use MCP evidence only when it replaces broad repository discovery, business/domain synthesis, unknown ownership discovery, or cross-module impact analysis.

The implementation benchmark also supports `--workflow tokenopt-prompt-chain` to measure the native TokenOpt prompt-pack path as one implementation run: requirement analysis/investigate PBI, PBI plan, then implement feature. This is useful when comparing prompt-pack usage against `baseline`, `speckit`, `tokenopt`, and `speckit-tokenopt` on the same PBI.

The workflow A/B report separates `raw total` tokens (`input + output + reasoning`) from `fresh total` tokens (`input - cached input + output + reasoning`). If Codex times out before a `turn.completed` usage event, the report marks usage as `timeout` and token deltas as unavailable instead of treating missing usage as zero. The diff and changed-file score are captured before validation runs, while files created by Maven/Gradle/test execution are reported separately as validation-generated files.

Modes:

```text
baseline: natural task prompt with normal Codex tools.
tokenopt-mcp: MCP enabled and the benchmark prompt explicitly names tokenopt_compile_evidence.
tokenopt-mcp-instructed: natural user prompt; TokenOpt routing comes only from injected project/agent instructions.
tokenopt-mcp+gate: MCP mode plus a deliberate redundant followup to verify answerability gating.
```

Use `tokenopt-mcp-instructed` when proving whether normal prompts like "Investigate flow X" or "write unittest for class Y" route through TokenOpt after setup. The JSON rows include `userPrompt`, `injectedInstruction`, and `prompt` so the benchmark shows what the user wrote versus what the agent setup supplied.

Do not paste `injectedInstruction`, `actualPromptSentToCodex`, or text such as `Project instruction injected by TokenOpt setup:` into a normal user prompt. Those fields are benchmark/report artifacts. A real prompt should contain only the actual task; repo instructions and MCP config supply TokenOpt guidance separately.

Task sets:

```text
daily: build handoff, investigate, business/domain research, implement handoff, unit-test handoff.
realistic: investigate primary flow, PBI/requirement implementation plan, unit-test plan for likely owning class/module, requirement WHAT/WHY/HOW/acceptance criteria analysis, and repo benchmark/evaluation material analysis.
all: daily + realistic.
```

The Codex benchmark rows also include `answerablePackets` and `fallbackAfterAnswerable`. A non-zero fallback means the agent kept exploring after TokenOpt had already marked the packet answerable.
